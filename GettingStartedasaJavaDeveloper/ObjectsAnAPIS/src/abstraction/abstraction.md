# **Abstraction**
- A non access modifier
- An abstract class is not designed to be instantiated, it is designed to be implemented.
- Its purpose is to serve as a super class for more sub class. 
- An abstract class can be subclass for another abstract class.
- If a subclass inherits from abstract class then it must implement all the abstract methods or make itself abstract.
